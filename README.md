I am using react as front-end framework & created the app using create react app 
https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html.

For buying & selling the token I am using metamask wallet 
https://metamask.io/swaps.html

connected react app with metamask account using web3 react
https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3-react

using the Ganache to get testing eatherium

I have made the functionality of buy and sell the token on the frontend side but facing issues with the truffle package installation & connected account with truffle which is the important framework Ethereum token.Because I am not a blockchain master I'm confronting loads of issues with truffle. But my ranges of abilities of Javascript and React js are great
